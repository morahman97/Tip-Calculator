Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
* [X] Allow custom tip percentage input

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Initially, I wanted to fourth segment to the segmented control UI to allow for custom percentage input.
However, I found it a bit complicated to implement since my approach was to generate an alert to input the custom percentage, but I had difficulty turning that input into a tangible percentage to work with.
So alternatively, I made another text input similar to the bill to input a custom percentage and implemented the feature that way.
